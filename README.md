# Classification Project - Iris and Seeds Datasets

This project was completed for my Intro to Data Mining course. I applied various classification techniques to two datasets (Iris and Seeds) and evaluated their performance.

## Summary
- Built and evaluated Decision Trees, Na√Øve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Rule-Based (JRip) classifiers on the Iris dataset.
- Built and evaluated Decision Tree classifier on the Seeds dataset.
- Metrics reported include Accuracy, Precision, Recall (Sensitivity), Specificity, and F1-Measure.
- Applied k-Fold Cross-Validation (k = 5, 10, 15, 20) to evaluate model generalization.
- ROC Curves plotted and interpreted for the Iris dataset.

## Technologies
- R (rpart, e1071, class, RWeka, caret, pROC packages)
- RStudio
- GitHub

## Files
- `Classification Project WIP 1.pdf`: Initial R code for Iris dataset models.
- `Classification Project Final Code.pdf`: Rest of the R code for both the Iris and Seeds dataset model.
- `Classification_Project_SP25.pdf`: Full project report with results, discussion, and conclusions.

## Results
- Decision Trees achieved strong performance on both datasets, with higher testing accuracy on Iris (~95.56%) compared to Seeds (~88.89%).
- Models generalized well with minimal overfitting.
